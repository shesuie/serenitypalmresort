    <h2>Session cookies</h2>
    <p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that are essential for the 
        functioning of websites. They are stored on your device only for the 
        duration of your visit to a website and are automatically deleted when 
        you close your browser. These cookies enable essential functions such 
        as user authentication, maintaining your session state while navigating 
        the website, and ensuring secure transactions. Session cookies do not 
        collect any personal information and are necessary for providing you 
        with a seamless browsing experience.</p>

    <h2>Persistent cookies</h2>
    <p>Persistent cookies, unlike session cookies, are stored on your device 
        for a longer period, even after you close your browser. These 
        cookies remain on your device until their expiration date or 
        until you manually delete them. Persistent cookies are used to 
        remember your preferences and settings across multiple visits 
        to a website, making your browsing experience more personalized 
        and convenient.</p>

    <p>They can store information such as login credentials, language 
        preferences, and items in your shopping cart, allowing you to 
        resume your activities seamlessly. Persistent cookies also enable 
        website owners to track and analyze user behavior over time, 
        helping them improve their services and tailor content to better 
        suit your interests.</p>

    <h2>First party cookies</h2>
    <p>First-party cookies are set by the website you are currently 
        visiting, and they are used to enhance your browsing experience 
        on that particular website. These cookies are typically used to 
        remember your preferences, such as language settings or items in 
        your shopping cart, and to provide personalized content based on 
        your interactions with the website.</p>

    <p>First-party cookies are considered essential for the website's 
        functionality and do not track your activity across different 
        websites. They help improve the performance and usability of 
        the website by enabling features like user authentication, 
        session management, and website analytics.</p>

    <h2>Third party cookies</h2>
    <p>Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by domains other 
        than the one you are currently visiting. These cookies are often 
        used by advertisers or analytics providers to track your browsing 
        behavior across different websites and to serve targeted 
        advertisements. Third-party cookies can collect information 
        about your online activities, such as the pages you visit, the 
        links you click, and the ads you interact with, in order to create 
        a profile of your interests and preferences.</p>

    <p>This information is then used to deliver personalized ads and 
        content to you on other websites. While third-party cookies can 
        enhance the relevance of advertisements and improve the effectiveness 
        of marketing campaigns, they also raise privacy concerns regarding the 
        tracking of users across the web.</p>

    <h2>Which third party cookies does serenity palm resort use?</h2>
    <p>Serenity Palm Resort may utilize third-party cookies from Google 
        for various purposes such as analytics, advertising, and social 
        media integration. These cookies are typically set by Google 
        services such as Google Analytics, Google Ads (formerly known 
        as Google AdWords), and Google Tag Manager. Google Analytics 
        cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website, 
        allowing us to analyze traffic patterns, measure the effectiveness 
        of our marketing efforts, and improve the user experience. Google 
        Ads cookies may be used to track the performance of our advertising 
        campaigns and to serve targeted ads to users based on their browsing 
        behavior.</p>
